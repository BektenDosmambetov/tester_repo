		<h2>Hello my friend!</h2>
		<p class="first_paragraph">Let me tell you a little bit about myself and this site. My nickname is Cleric1376, and I've made this site to share my experience of entering IT field as a tester. I don't have either appropriate bachelor degree nor an experience. What I'm trying to do is to completelly change my career and life</p>

		<p class="second_paragraph">Actually right now I'm on the very begining of tester path. At the moment I have only read a pair of books on Software Testing, finished two online courses. Of course I'm learning pretty much, for example now I'm learning HTML & CSS by online course, at the same time I'm reading a book, and trying to fill gaps in Software Testing by reading Wikipedia and internet articles.</p>

		<p class="third_paragraph">I will write all my thoughts, intersting stuff related to Software testing and findings in my blog, let's call it the Tester Path's blog. Also I will be happy to receive feedback. So the journey has begun.<br><span style="color: red; font-size: 18px"><strong>Cleric1376</strong><br></span></p>
