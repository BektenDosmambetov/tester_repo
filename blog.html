		<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
		<p>
		Hello again! <br>
		My name is Bekten, but I prefer my nickname Cleric1376, you can call me by name or by nickname, which way you prefer. Currently I want to change my carrier path and my life. So I’ve chosen the carrier of a QA automation engineer. As you’ve probably realized, I’m creating own web site for the following reasons: <br>
		1-st I’d like to hone my skills in HTML5 and CSS3, <br>
		2-nd to learn from inside the CSS selectors, as you know CSS selectors are needed in Selenium <br>
		3-rd to share my personal experience through writing articles in my blog <br>

		<h2>My thoughts on Udemy courses</h2>
		<p>
		Actually I like that learning platform, at the present moment I’ve actually finished several courses, I will write about them below. But first I’d like to state reasons I like the Udemy: <br>
		1-st affordable price for complete beginner who actually doesn’t know from where to start, some courses are absolutely free. <br>
		2-nd I work to earn my living, so I don’t have enough time to study at the traditional courses, simply my irregular working shift doesn’t allow that. <br>
		3-rd I have chance to learn during my lunch time at the work. <br>
		Now let me desribe the courses I’ve taken on Udemy:<br>
		1-st I’ve learnt some courses on Software Testing, almost all of them are an entry level and free. <br>
		2-nd I’ve taken a pair of courses on Git and GitHub, both of them for beginner level and free. <br>
		3-rd three courses on HTML and CSS and Webdesign, all are free. <br>
		4-th I’ve bought several courses mainly on Python development related to Software testing and webdesign. <br>
		Bottom-line: I spent approximately 60$ on the six courses, most of them I’m not finished yet, they awaiting me :-), and also I’ve taken approximately 10 courses that are absolutely free. Those free courses, in spite their entry level, help me made a mental road map to my goal, and I’m very grateful to Udemy platform.

		<h2>My Stepik.org online courses</h2>
		<p>
		I’ve found another great resource, Stepik.org. In spite, it’s mainly for learners who know Russian language, it a great online platform. I like almost everything in Stepik.org, the syllabus, lab works, chapter tasks, friendly community. If you know Russian language, go and check it.
		My first choice in Stepik was a course on Selenium for testers, but in the process of learning, I’ve decided to dive more deeply in HTML5 and CSS3. I need not only to have a better grasp on CSS selectors, I also want to finish my web site. So I found the HTML5 and CSS3 course on Stepik and I’m very happy now. Stepik gives me opportunity to make my knowledge more solid. The site was restructured and the design it has now is mainly with the knowledge I obtained from Stepik.org. I’m very grateful to Stepik.org platform and highly recommend it.
